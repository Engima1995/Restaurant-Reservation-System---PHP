# Restaurant Reservation System - Final Year Project

This project is based on providing users with the ability to browse the website and choose their city of choice and further browse restaurants in which they will book a table on a particular time and date and get a booking.

The information provided by the users is then stored on the database to allow future queries to be made by the administrator.

The administrator feature is built in to the website where only administrators can log in and manage any bookings made by the customers. 

Other functionalities such as email has also been added for customers wanting to make any changes to their bookings.

Overall functionalities added to the system include:

* Table Bookings
* Tables Unavailable once a booking has been made
* Administrator login system
* Administrator managing the bookings such as Adding, Editing or Deleting Customer Information.
* Administrator checcking reservation dates
* Email for querying

Although the system has these features, it is still not a complete system. 

Many improvements are to be made such as:

	* Having a seperate managing page for administrators using a entirely different GUI instead of integratin it into the same website, which promotes vulnerabilities

	* Adding dynamic content which is constantly up to date rather than static/manually created information

This project was done for understanding how to use a framework as well as to get better at developing using PHP. It also helped understanding PHP by the integrating different languages to communicate with another to pass data along.
